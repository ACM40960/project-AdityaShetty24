# AI Meme Challenge

The project aims to test the existing neural network algorithm for image classification of Meme images which are very similar to each other.

## Setting up python notebook
-> Open your Google Drive

-> Upload the .ipynb file > Open with > Google Colaboratory  

## GPU Setting
Edit > Notebook settings or Runtime>Change runtime type and select GPU as Hardware accelerator

#### Install Libraries :

Google Colab is built for running Machine Learning projects hence has most of the libraries installed, but for assurance we can copy paste the entire list of libraries below and install them at a go.

`!pip install` or `!apt-get install`

```http
!pip3 install tensorflow==1.8
!pip3 install keras
!pip3 install torch torchvision
!apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
!pip install colorama
!pip install os
!pip install math
!pip install shutil
```
### After the setup is ready, run all the code chunks together

### GUI

At the very end of our project the GUI will run automatically for testing, here you can upload a meme image from your local setup and check the accuracy.
